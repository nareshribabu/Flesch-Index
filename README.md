# Flesch-Index
This program calculates the Flesch Index given a text file. Additionally, the program also calculates the syllables, word count, and sentence count.

The Flesch Index was invented by Rudolf Flesch. It is used to determine the legibility of any given document without using any professional linguistic analysis tools.

The index is usually between 0 to 100. (90-100 would mean the document is very easy to read).
